# RUNTH

## Project Overview
RUNTH is dedicated to enhancing the safety and enjoyment of running for women globally. Our platform leverages extensive user research to develop features that address safety concerns and promote active lifestyles through technology and community engagement.

### Key Research Findings
- **High Concern for Safety**: A study by Adidas reveals that 92% of women express concern for their safety while running, highlighting the need for improved safety measures.
- **Harassment Experiences**: According to Runner's World, 60% of women surveyed have experienced harassment during runs, including unwanted comments and following.
- **Physical and Mental Impact**: The adverse effects of harassment include significant anxiety (53%) and a decreased interest in running (46%).
- **Global Issue**: The harassment of women runners is a widespread issue across various countries, underscoring the universal need for safer running environments.

## Monetization and Entrepreneurial Strategies
RUNTH seeks to create a sustainable business model that supports our mission while engaging the local and global community through the following channels:

- **Subscription Model**: Premium subscriptions offer exclusive access to enhanced safety features, personalized route recommendations, and detailed analytics on running performance and safety metrics.
- **Partnerships with Local Businesses**: Collaborations with fitness-related businesses and local retailers provide users with discounts and promotions, enhancing local economic engagement.
- **Advertising**: We integrate targeted advertising from reputable sports brands and health and wellness companies that align with our users' lifestyles.
- **Safety Gear and Merchandise**: We sell branded safety gear such as reflective clothing and personal safety alarms. Partnerships with existing brands allow us to offer co-branded products.
- **Event Sponsorships and Organization**: We organize and sponsor local running events that focus on women's safety, leveraging our platform's community for participation and brand visibility.
- **Data Insights and Analytics Services**: We provide analytics services to urban planners and local authorities using aggregated user data to enhance public spaces and running routes.

## Mission for Social Good
Our project is not just a businessâ€”-it's a movement towards creating safer and more enjoyable running experiences for women. By focusing on innovative solutions and community-based initiatives, RUNTH aims to make a tangible impact on public health, safety, and women's well-being for social inclusivity.

## Hackathon Goals
- **Best Health Hack**: Our web application covers women's physical and mental health through service accessibility and information technology at hand by focusing on routes generated by our customized GPT. We prioritize safety, beautiful scenery, and traffic data in route generation. 
- **Best User Research Award**: Our comprehensive research into the experiences of women runners globally positions us as a strong contender for this award by bringing perspectives of 4 years of traveling around the world while running.
- **Best Interdisciplinary Hack**: By integrating technology, health and safety research, and entrepreneurial context over business monetization, our project represents a leading interdisciplinary approach to addressing public safety and wellness.
- **Best Beginner Hack**: We are all beginners in hackathon. 

Join us in making running a safer, more enjoyable, and empowering experience for women everywhere. Together, we can outrun harassment and redefine safety in sports.
